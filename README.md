# Simple-Web-Browser-Python-

MyWebBrowser is a simple lightweight browser built with Python using the PyQt5 library. It features standard functionality including Forward, Back, Refresh, and Home buttons. It also includes a custom user-agent string to simulate a modern desktop browser environment. 

The interface is simple yet functional, making it a great starting point for learning how to embed web content in desktop applications using PyQt. With support for JavaScript and responsive controls like Enter-key URL navigation and dynamic URL bar updates, MyWebBrowser serves both as an educational project and a foundation for building more advanced browsing tools.
